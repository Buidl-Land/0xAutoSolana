# Sub-task: Implement Solana Contract for Subscriptions (ROO#SUB_005_S005)

**Parent Task:** [ROO#NAV_PLAN_005](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PLAN_005/context.md)
**Depends on:** [ROO#SUB_005_S003](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_005_S003/context.md) (Integrate Prisma and Remove Mock Data)

**Goal for Expert (rooroo-developer):**
1.  Analyze the existing Solana contract code for subscription functionality.
2.  Identify or implement the contract function(s) responsible for creating, managing, and checking user subscriptions.
3.  Integrate the frontend to call these Solana contract functions. This includes:
    *   Connecting to the user's Solana wallet.
    *   Allowing users to select a subscription plan.
    *   Constructing and sending the transaction for subscription.
    *   Handling transaction status.
4.  Update the user's subscription status and details in the database (via Prisma) upon successful transaction.
5.  Ensure the UI allows users to subscribe and reflects their current subscription status.
6.  Implement logic to check subscription validity for accessing features.

**Key Information:**
*   Solana contract details (address, ABI, relevant functions for subscriptions).
*   Prisma is integrated for database interactions.
*   Wallet connection logic should be in place or enhanced.

**Deliverables:**
*   Functional subscription feature using a Solana contract.
*   Frontend components for selecting plans, subscribing, and displaying subscription status.
*   Backend logic to verify subscription transactions and update user data.
*   Code for checking subscription status to gate features.
