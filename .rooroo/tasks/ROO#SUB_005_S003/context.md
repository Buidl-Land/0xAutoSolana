# Sub-task: Integrate Prisma and Remove Mock Data (ROO#SUB_005_S003)

**Parent Task:** [ROO#NAV_PLAN_005](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PLAN_005/context.md)
**Depends on:**
*   [ROO#SUB_005_S001](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_005_S001/context.md) (Setup and Merge Branches)
*   [ROO#SUB_005_S002](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_005_S002/context.md) (Analyze and Identify Mock Data) - specifically the [.rooroo/artifacts/ROO#SUB_005_S002_mock_data_analysis.md](.rooroo/artifacts/ROO#SUB_005_S002_mock_data_analysis.md) report.

**Goal for Expert (rooroo-developer):**
1.  Based on the `prisma` branch merge (ROO#SUB_005_S001) and the mock data analysis report ([.rooroo/artifacts/ROO#SUB_005_S002_mock_data_analysis.md](.rooroo/artifacts/ROO#SUB_005_S002_mock_data_analysis.md)), configure and initialize Prisma in the project if not already fully set up.
2.  Define Prisma schema (e.g., in `prisma/schema.prisma`) to match the data structures identified in the analysis (users, agents, wallets, subscriptions, points, etc.).
3.  Generate Prisma Client.
4.  Systematically replace all identified mock data implementations with Prisma Client calls for data fetching, creation, updates, and deletion.
5.  Remove the mock data files and code sections once they are fully replaced by Prisma.
6.  Ensure all existing functionalities that previously used mock data now correctly use Prisma and interact with the database.
7.  Set up database migrations and apply them.

**Key Information:**
*   Utilize the mock data analysis from [.rooroo/artifacts/ROO#SUB_005_S002_mock_data_analysis.md](.rooroo/artifacts/ROO#SUB_005_S002_mock_data_analysis.md).
*   The Prisma setup might be partially present from the `prisma` branch; complete it as necessary.
*   The database connection string and other Prisma configurations should be managed appropriately (e.g., via environment variables).

**Deliverables:**
*   Codebase with all mock data removed and replaced by Prisma data operations.
*   A working Prisma setup, including schema, client, and migrations.
*   Confirmation that application functionalities reliant on data are working correctly with the database via Prisma.
