# Sub-task: Testing and Quality Assurance (ROO#SUB_005_S007)

**Parent Task:** [ROO#NAV_PLAN_005](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PLAN_005/context.md)
**Depends on:**
*   [ROO#SUB_005_S003](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_005_S003/context.md) (Prisma Integration)
*   [ROO#SUB_005_S004](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_005_S004/context.md) (Points Top-up)
*   [ROO#SUB_005_S005](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_005_S005/context.md) (Subscriptions)
*   [ROO#SUB_005_S006](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_005_S006/context.md) (Abstract Wallet)

**Goal for Expert (rooroo-analyzer):**
1.  Perform comprehensive testing of all new and modified functionalities on the feature branch. This includes:
    *   Data fetching and manipulation via Prisma (CRUD operations for all relevant entities).
    *   Points top-up functionality: successful transactions, failed transactions, balance updates.
    *   Subscription functionality: successful subscriptions, plan changes, cancellations (if applicable), status checks, feature gating.
    *   Abstract wallet interactions: connection with multiple supported wallet types, transaction signing, error handling.
2.  Conduct regression testing to ensure existing functionalities are not broken.
3.  Verify data integrity in the database.
4.  Test user flows related to these new features.
5.  Document any bugs, issues, or inconsistencies found in a testing report.

**Key Information:**
*   Testing should cover various scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.
*   The application should be tested with a real (devnet/testnet) Solana environment and database.

**Deliverables:**
*   A comprehensive testing report (`.rooroo/artifacts/ROO#SUB_005_S007_qa_report.md`) detailing:
    *   Test cases executed.
    *   Results of each test case (pass/fail).
    *   Detailed descriptions of any bugs or issues found, including steps to reproduce.
    *   Overall assessment of the stability and correctness of the implemented features.
