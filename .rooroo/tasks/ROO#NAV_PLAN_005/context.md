User request:
Please help me merge the contract code from the following repository: https://github.com/Buidl-Land/0xAutoSolana.git and the prisma branch.
Then, delete all Mock Data and use Prisma to fetch real data.
Also, support using the corresponding contract to top up points and subscribe, as well as an abstract wallet.
Finally, push the changes to https://github.com/Buidl-Land/0xAutoSolana.git as the main branch.

Key objectives:
1.  Merge `prisma` branch into a working branch (e.g., `main` or a new feature branch).
2.  Identify and remove all mock data implementations.
3.  Integrate Prisma for all data fetching and manipulation, replacing mock data sources.
4.  Implement functionality to top up points using a Solana contract.
5.  Implement functionality for subscriptions using a Solana contract.
6.  Implement an abstract wallet solution.
7.  Push the final, tested code to the `main` branch of the specified repository.
