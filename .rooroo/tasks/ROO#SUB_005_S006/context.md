# Sub-task: Implement Abstract Wallet Solution (ROO#SUB_005_S006)

**Parent Task:** [ROO#NAV_PLAN_005](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PLAN_005/context.md)
**Depends on:**
*   [ROO#SUB_005_S004](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_005_S004/context.md) (Implement Solana Contract for Points Top-up)
*   [ROO#SUB_005_S005](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_005_S005/context.md) (Implement Solana Contract for Subscriptions)

**Goal for Expert (rooroo-developer):**
1.  Design and implement an abstract wallet interface or layer within the application. This layer should:
    *   Provide a consistent API for interacting with different types of Solana wallets (e.g., Phantom, Solflare, hardware wallets if applicable).
    *   Handle wallet connection, disconnection, and account selection.
    *   Facilitate transaction signing and sending through the selected wallet.
2.  Refactor the points top-up (ROO#SUB_005_S004) and subscription (ROO#SUB_005_S005) features to use this abstract wallet layer.
3.  Ensure the wallet interactions are user-friendly and secure.
4.  Consider using existing libraries or SDKs that provide wallet adapter functionalities (e.g., Solana Wallet Adapter).

**Key Information:**
*   The goal is to decouple the application logic from specific wallet implementations.
*   The solution should support common Solana wallet operations.
*   Refer to Solana best practices for wallet integration.

**Deliverables:**
*   An abstract wallet layer integrated into the application.
*   Updated points top-up and subscription features using the new wallet abstraction.
*   Documentation for the abstract wallet interface and its usage.
*   Improved user experience for wallet interactions.
