**Parent Task:** [ROO#NAV_PLAN_005](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PLAN_005/context.md)

**Goal for Expert (rooroo-developer):**

2.  Create a new feature branch (e.g., `feature/prisma-solana-integration`) from the current `main` branch (or the default branch if `main` doesn't exist).
3.  Merge the `prisma` branch from the remote repository into this new feature branch.
4.  Identify and resolve any merge conflicts.
5.  Ensure the project builds and runs successfully after the merge.

**Key Information:**
*   Repository URL: `https://github.com/Buidl-Land/0xAutoSolana.git`
*   Source branch for merge: `prisma`
*   Target branch for merge: New feature branch (e.g., `feature/prisma-solana-integration`)

**Deliverables:**
*   A local feature branch with the `prisma` branch successfully merged.
*   Confirmation that the project builds and basic functionalities are intact post-merge.
