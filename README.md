# 0xAuto OS: Automate Your AI Strategies, Powered by MCP and A2A!

Still managing Web3 manually? Too much information to process? Missing opportunities?

Say goodbye to tedious tasks and embrace intelligence! Introducing 0xAuto OS!

## What is 0xAuto OS?

Simply put, 0xAuto OS is an AI-powered operating system designed specifically for the Web3 world. Imagine having a team of AI-driven, 24/7 intelligent assistants (we call them Agents) at your disposal. These Agents not only help you automatically acquire and process massive amounts of information but also execute various complex tasks on schedule according to your specifications, such as DEX trading, token issuance, market movement monitoring, and more—while you can completely free your hands!

This is all made possible by our unique technical architecture:

- **Intelligent Agents**: Customizable AI robots that serve as your automated executors in the Web3 world.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) & A2A (Agent2Agent Protocol)**: We use universal open protocols that enable your Agents to easily access external capabilities (data, models, APIs) and other Agents' capabilities, essentially giving them wings. Developers and project teams can easily connect and contribute to the ecosystem.
- **Multi-Agent System**: Multiple Agents working together to handle more complex tasks, multiplying their effectiveness.
- **Abstract Wallet**: A secure, programmable built-in wallet that allows your Agents to automatically execute on-chain transactions and asset management on your behalf, enabling truly automated quantitative investments.
- **Core Advantage: Scheduled Execution!** Set it once, and Agents automatically execute tasks according to schedule, without requiring conversation or manual initiation each time, completely eliminating repetitive labor.
