*   `feedId`: STRING (Primary Key, Unique identifier)
*   `userId`: STRING (Foreign Key, references User.userId)
*   `agentId`: STRING (Foreign Key, references Agent.agentId, identifies the source agent)

*   `createdAt`: DATETIME

## Relationships:
*   A `User` can have multiple `Agent`s. (One-to-Many)
*   An `Agent` belongs to one `User`.
*   An `Agent` can have multiple `AgentActivityLog` entries. (One-to-Many)
*   An `AgentActivityLog` entry belongs to one `Agent`.
*   A `User` has one `Wallet` (AbstractWallet). (One-to-One, conceptually)
*   A `User` can have multiple `WatchedFeed`s. (One-to-Many)
*   A `WatchedFeed` is typically generated by one `Agent`.

This model provides a foundation for the data displayed on the dashboard. Further details might be added as other pages and functionalities are defined.
